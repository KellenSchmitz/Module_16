## Summary
There is a significant difference between the % of paid reviews that received 5-stars and unpaid reviews. However, it should be noted that the sample size for paid reviews was small, with 90 total reviews compared to over 37,000 unpaid reviews. It might be that unpaid cover a much larger range of quality versus the games that received a paid review. To test this, it would be a good idea to compare unpaid and paid reviews for the same titles.
